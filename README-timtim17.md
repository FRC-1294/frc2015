This fork is just for me to keep the programming team's progress in LabVIEW while I don't have write access to the official repo [here](https://www.github.com/FRC-1294/frc2015/).

[`LabVIEW\Software Drive Base`](LabVIEW\Software Drive Base) is a basic arcade drive template modified for 4 motor CAN Jaguar Tank Drive, with options for Y or X axis drive per request.

[`LabVIEW\Dashboard`](LabVIEW\Dashboard) is the basic dashboard, with the exception of a list front panel module to select Y or X axis drive.
